# Social Unrest Prediction Through Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Using Support Vector Machine: Experimental Study on Nigeria’s #EndSARS
This repository contains the code and dataset used in the paper ["Social Unrest Prediction Through Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Using Support Vector Machine: Experimental Study on Nigeria’s #EndSARS"](https://doi.org/10.1515/opis-2022-0141), published in Open Information Science, vol. 7, no. 1, 2023, pp. 20220138.

Using sentiment analysis on Twitter and a focus on the #EndSARS movement, the study sought to predict societal unrest in Nigeria. The research analyzed tweets relating to the #EndSARS campaign and determined the attitude expressed in them using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and natural language processing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in the paper is included in the repository in the dataset folder. It contains a collection of tweets related to the #EndSARS movement in Nigeria, along with their sentiment labels.

## Code
In the code folder contains the code that was employed in the studies. The program is written in Python and implements support vector machines using the scikit-learn library and text preprocessing using the NLTK library.

## Conclusion
The study showed how sentiment analysis and machine learning may be used to predict social unrest on Twitter, especially in the context of the #EndSARS movement in Nigeria. For additional research in this field, the code and dataset offered in this repository might be used.
